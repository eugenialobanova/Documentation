# Welcome to Vostok

_A complete microservice toolkit for .NET developers._

**Feature complete.** Vostok has everything to create, monitor and troubleshoot microservices. No other tools or libraries are required.

**Sanely pre-configured.** Vostok has a ready to use template for an ASP.NET Core 2.0 application as well as Docker files for Vostok infrastructure components. Zero configuration is required to get started.

**Fast by design.** Vostok is benchmarked and optimized for performance and throughput. No expensive hardware is required. Commodity servers are just fine for Vostok.

### Getting started with Vostok {#getting-started-with-vostok}

You can easily create and run your first Vostok-enabled application:

* Install and run [Spaceport](https://github.com/vostok/spaceport#spaceport), a single-host bundle with all Vostok components.
* Install and use [Launchpad](https://github.com/vostok/launchpad#launchpad) to create a Vostok-instrumented application from a template.
* Make some HTTP requests to that application and explore results in Grafana, Kibana and Contrails.
